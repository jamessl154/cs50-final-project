        Problems deciding how the divs are scaled
        If the gain_loss that is largest is always the same size on the screen will it look strange?
        A loss of 10% and a gain of 1000% will look the same drawn on the page if they are the largest items
        Not if the user is comparing only against a single portfolio at once
        Why could it be good?
        Excessively small/large gains/losses in a single portfolio look odd/not visible to the user
        but also the largest gain or loss is the most important detail to the user in tracking his/her progress
        From application.py:
        1 sorted arrays of objects, x
            which contain key ID for the transaction in sharedate form
            and gain_loss in $
        The largest gain_loss in $ form, y

        What the functions do:
        Displays all the results visually of a portfolio first separated by gain or loss
        then ordered by most to least gained/lost
        by creating empty divs all scaled to a parent (which is the largest gain/loss 
        which has width 50%) to show relative performance
        all div elements are uniquely identified and still retain their $ gain/loss
    -->

    {% for i in x %}
        <div class="gain_element" href='/share/<{{ i["unique_id"] }}>' style='flex: {{ i["net"] }};'></div>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
